# AI Introduction
A shallow introduction article to AI and common buzz words around it. The article was written with latex. Compile it to PDF to read it properly or just open the [compiled PDF](https://github.com/DiscoverAI/ai-intro/blob/master/ai-intro-article.pdf) file included.

The PDF contains a glossary if you want to have quick short explanations for certain words. Apart from that a lot of searchable words are bold faced and can be used to find more material.

Each section and chapter can be read individually.

## Compile
Run:
```bash
./makePDF
```

This should create a pdf file version of the article.
